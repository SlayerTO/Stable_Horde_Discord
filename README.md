## Version Requirements

- NodeJS >= 16.16

Optional:  
- PostgreSQL >= 14.6

## How to set up

1) download the code from this repository  
2) get the token of your discord bot (https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#authentication)  
3) Install the node modules using `npm i` (make sure the dev dependencies are also installed for typescript to work)  
4) remove the `template.` from the `template.config.json` file  
  
If you want to have extra functionality do the following steps:  

5) set up a postgres database  
6) fill out the `template.env` and rename it to `.env`  
  
If you just want to generate images with no token or the default token in the config.json file do the following steps:  

5) modify the config file and set `use_database` to false  
6) fill out the `template.env` and rename it to `.env` (you can leave the keys prefixed with `DB_` empty)  
  
7) Run `npm run generate-key` and copy the generated encryption key in your `.env` (If you disabled token encryption you can leave it blank)
8) modify the [config.json](https://github.com/ZeldaFan0225/AI_Horde_Discord/blob/main/template.config.json) file (from step 4) to fit your needs (you can read about what which property does in [config.md](https://github.com/ZeldaFan0225/AI_Horde_Discord/blob/main/config.md))  
9) compile the code and start the process (this can be done by using `npm run deploy`)  
  
Now if everything is set up it should start and give an output in the console.  


## Encryption Key
When changing your encryption key after deployment the tokens won't be decrypted properly.  
Avoid changing the encryption key after initial setup.
Disabling encryption at any point will make commands for users who saved their tokens in an encrypted form not work any more.

## How to update

1) Pull the code from this repository
2) Update your config. Reading through the [changelog](https://github.com/ZeldaFan0225/AI_Horde_Discord/blob/main/changelog.md) might help.
